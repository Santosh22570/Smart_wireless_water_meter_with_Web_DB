## ⚙️ Hardware Setup

![Schematic](Images/Schematic.png)

1. Connect all sensors to Arduino UNO and ESP32 accordingly.
2. Ensure correct voltage levels and power supply.

---

## 💻 Firmware Installation

1. Install **Arduino IDE** and add board support for ESP32.
2. Install libraries
3. Upload the respective firmware to:
   - ESP32: for Wi-Fi and ThingSpeak communication
   - Arduino UNO: for reading and preprocessing sensor data
4. Configure:
   - Wi-Fi credentials
   - ThingSpeak channel & API keys

---

## 🌐 ThingSpeak Setup

1. Create a new **[ThingSpeak Channel](https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/)**
2. Add the following fields:
   - TDS Level
   - pH Level
3. Copy the Write API Key and use it in your ESP32 code.

---

## 🚀 System Workflow
1. The sensors gather real-time data via Arduino UNO and ESP32.
2. Data is sent to ESP32, which uploads it to ThingSpeak.
3. ThingSpeak displays data using dynamic graphs.
4. The Relay triggers the pump based on sensor thresholds.
5. The LCD displays key metrics locally for manual monitoring.
